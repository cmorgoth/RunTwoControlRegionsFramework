This Repository is intended to become a frameworks for the
Caltech/Razor Run Two LHC effort to estimate different bakground
contributions using various data control regions.

This framework can plot relevant distribution in the different
control regions as well as defining the scale factors (SF) 
obtained from the different control regions.

MC NORMALIZATION

To Normalize the MC to Data use the NormalizeMC executable obtained after doing make on the head of the directory.

As now the luminosity is hard coded to be 18.84 fb-1 in the app/Normalize_SMbkgs.cc file.

To nomalize MC use an input file with format as in: InputFiles/AllFilesToNormalize.txt

To use the program just do:
./NormalizeMC InputFile OutputDir
